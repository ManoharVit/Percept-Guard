# Percept-Guard
Evaluate defense mechanisms against adversarial attacks on object detection models, a critical challenge in maintaining integrity of real-time systems. Implement and test strategies such as adversarial training, ensemble modeling using YOLO, SSD, R-CNN on datasets like MS COCO, to deliver reliable solutions that address pressing security concerns
